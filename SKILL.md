# Commons Building

A skill for designing open infrastructure that makes paywalls and artificial scarcity obsolete.

## When to Use

- When fighting enclosure is less effective than building alternatives
- When the commons needs infrastructure to function
- When network effects could serve openness instead of lock-in
- When you have resources to build, not just critique

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Define the Commons

Clarify what will be shared:
- What resource will be available to all?
- What rights do users have? (Use, modification, redistribution)
- What is explicitly not enclosed? (Data, content, code, infrastructure)
- What are the boundaries of this commons?

Clear definition prevents later enclosure.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design for Openness

Build with openness in the architecture:
- Open source code
- Open standards and protocols
- Open data formats
- Federated or decentralized structure where possible
- APIs that enable interoperability

Avoid dependencies on proprietary systems or single points of control.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Plan Sustainability

The commons must persist:
- How is development funded? (Grants, donations, membership, services)
- How is hosting/infrastructure funded?
- Who maintains it, and with what incentives?
- How does it survive the loss of any individual?

Commons that depend on unsustainable labor collapse.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Build Community

The commons is tended by its users:
- How do people find this?
- How do they contribute?
- How are decisions made?
- How are conflicts resolved?
- What governance prevents capture?

Technical infrastructure without community is empty.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Compete on Features

Make the open option better:
- Identify where proprietary systems fail users
- Build features that enclosure prevents
- User experience should not require sacrifice
- "Almost as good but free" loses to "better and free"

People use what works.

## Outputs
A commons-building plan including:
1. Definition of the commons and what it provides
2. Technical architecture supporting openness
3. Sustainability model with realistic numbers
4. Community development strategy
5. Competitive advantages over enclosed alternatives
6. Governance structure preventing capture

## Constraints

- Sustainability is not optional - unfunded commons die
- Governance matters - ungoverned commons get captured
- Users need reasons beyond ideology to switch
- Network effects are hard to overcome - plan accordingly
- Some enclosure funds valuable work - acknowledge tradeoffs

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Build commons alternative to proprietary academic journal system

**Output**:
"Commons: Open access journal platform with author-side APC-free model. Defined: All published research immediately available under CC-BY. Code, infrastructure, and governance all open. Architecture: Federated platform - universities and learned societies host their own instances, interoperable through shared protocol. No single point of control. Sustainability: Funding consortium of university libraries redirecting subscription funds. Estimated cost $300/article vs current $3,000 average. Libraries already spending the money - this redirects it. Community: Editorial boards recruited from researchers frustrated with current system. Overlay journals for low-cost disciplinary organizing. Peer review tracking and credit. Competitive advantages: No embargo, author retains rights, transparent peer review, better discoverability, actually fulfills funders' mandates. Governance: Elected board from member institutions, published decision-making processes, explicit anti-capture provisions in charter."

## Integration

Works with:
- **open-access-audit**: Audit reveals what commons is needed
- **systemic-analysis**: Understanding enclosure helps design alternatives
- **technical-civil-disobedience**: Bridges period until commons is built
